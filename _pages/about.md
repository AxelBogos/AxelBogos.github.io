Currently pursuing an M.Sc, 
I previously completed an Honours co-op B.Sc at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca) with a final project under 
the supervision of [Leila Kosseim](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kosseim/). <br><br>
My current topics of interest revolve around Deep Learning, Tranformer architecture and Natural Language Processing.
I am particularly interested in problems related to semantics parsing and reading comprehension and
natural language understanding.  <br>
